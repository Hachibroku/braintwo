# Django One-Shot

This is a project from Hack Reactor's 19-week Immersive Software Engineering Bootcamp. It is built to the specifications of the project page, and passes all of the included tests. I have added my own CSS to the static frontend to increase visual appeal and usability, however this was not a requirement of the project and was done after it's submission.
